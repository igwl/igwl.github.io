## FAQ: Addressing Investor Concerns

### What drives AVAX's $70 target?
The $70 level represents both technical and psychological significance. It aligns with Fibonacci retracement levels from AVAX's 2021 rally and serves as a critical resistance zone where institutional buyers historically enter positions.

### How does Bitcoin's price affect AVAX?
As a Tier-1 altcoin, AVAX maintains a 0.82 beta coefficient to BTC. This means AVAX typically experiences amplified price swings relative to Bitcoin. A 10% BTC rally could translate to 12â€“15% gains for AVAX under optimal conditions.

### Is $175 a realistic ATH projection?
While ambitious, this target considers multiple factors:
- Avalanche's expanding enterprise adoption
- Potential ETF approval for BTC/ETH in Q2 2025
- Network congestion metrics showing 40% QoQ growth

### What risks should investors monitor?
1. **Regulatory uncertainty**: SEC actions against major DeFi platforms
2. **Network congestion**: Transaction fees rising above $2.00
3. **Competitive landscape**: Ethereum's Layer-2 solutions gaining traction

### How does AVAX's volatility compare to peers?
| Asset | 30-Day Volatility | Beta to BTC | Market Cap Rank |
|-------|--------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| AVAX  | 42%                | 0.82        | #12             |
| SOL   | 48%                | 0.88        | #9              |
| ETH   | 35%                | 0.75        | #2              |
