# Binance DEX Trade Rush Program: Become a Market Maker or Partner Now

Decentralized exchanges have emerged as vital components in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape, and Binance DEX stands out as a pioneering platform that empowers users while driving innovation in peer-to-peer trading. With its upgraded dual-chain architecture combining Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain, this community-driven exchange has achieved significant milestones in user engagement and trading volume.

## Evolution of Binance DEX

Since its launch over two years ago, Binance DEX has consistently evolved to meet the changing needs of crypto traders. The platform's initial advantage stemmed from its on-chain matching engine and native Binance Chain integration, which provided fast, secure transactions while maintaining decentralization.

**Key upgrade highlights:**
- Dual-chain operation supporting BEP20 tokens
- Enhanced liquidity through cross-chain compatibility
- Expanded trading capabilities with smart contract functionality

The current platform infrastructure supports 161 trading pairs featuring major assets like BTC, ETH, BNB, MATIC, and DOGE, along with popular BSC tokens such as CAKE and BAKE. With weekly trading volume reaching $100 million and over 54,000 active weekly traders, Binance DEX has established itself as a significant player in the decentralized finance space.

## Strategic Synergy with Binance Smart Chain

The partnership between Binance DEX and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) represents a powerful combination of technological capabilities and ecosystem growth. As an open-source decentralized blockchain, BSC has rapidly become infrastructure for over 650 projects in just nine months, processing 9 million daily transactions with $23 billion in total value locked (TVL).

This strategic alignment brings multiple benefits:
- Access to innovative projects within the BSC ecosystem
- Cross-platform liquidity solutions
- Enhanced trading opportunities for users

The integration has proven particularly successful with popular BSC projects like CAKE and BAKE, which have become top trading pairs on Binance DEX. As more BSC projects seek decentralized listing opportunities, this partnership continues to strengthen.
