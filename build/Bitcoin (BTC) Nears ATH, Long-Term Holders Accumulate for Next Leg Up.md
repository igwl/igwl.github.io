# Bitcoin (BTC) Nears ATH, Long-Term Holders Accumulate for Next Leg Up

Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading near its all-time high (ATH) of $109,000, but this rally stands out due to the behavior of long-term holders. Unlike previous cycles, these investors are not selling despite the price surge, signaling strong confidence in future gains. Letâ€™s break down the key trends shaping Bitcoinâ€™s current trajectory.

## Key Trends Driving Bitcoinâ€™s Price Action

- **Long-term holders (150+ days) are accumulating BTC** instead of taking profits, indicating trust in higher prices.
- **Exchange reserves have dropped to a 6-year low** of 2.44 million BTC, reducing short-term selling pressure.
- **Network activity metrics suggest a potential breakout** as Bitcoinâ€™s Z-score approaches critical levels.

These dynamics highlight a shift in market psychology, with institutional and retail investors aligning on BTCâ€™s long-term value proposition.

## Why Long-Term Holders Arenâ€™t Selling

Data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant reveals that Bitcoin holders with coins dormant for over 150 days are maintaining their positions. This group, historically prone to profit-taking near ATHs, is now showing unprecedented conviction. The **Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR)** for long-term holders has declined, meaning fewer coins are being sold at a profit even as prices climb.

### FAQ: What Does SOPR Indicate About Market Sentiment?
The SOPR metric tracks whether spent coins are sold at a profit or loss. A declining SOPR for long-term holders suggests they are holding through volatility, anticipating further appreciation. This behavior often precedes major rallies.

Historically, surges toward ATHs triggered profit-taking cycles. For example, in late 2021, SOPR spiked as long-term holders cashed out, leading to a sharp correction. The current divergence from this pattern implies stronger underlying demand.

## Short-Term Traders Fueling Volatility

While long-term holders remain patient, **short-term traders and retail investors** are driving Bitcoinâ€™s day-to-day price swings. These investors react swiftly to macroeconomic news, technical levels, and social sentiment. Their activity explains the recent consolidation between $101,000 and $104,900â€”a range that has persisted for over a week.

Captain Faibik, a prominent crypto analyst, notes that breaking above $104,900 with strong volume could trigger a new leg up. However, bears have repeatedly defended this level, creating a tug-of-war between bullish accumulation and profit-taking pressure.

## Exchange Reserves Hit 6-Year Low

A critical development is the **plummeting BTC supply on exchanges**, which fell to 2.44 million coins as of May 15â€”its lowest since 2018. Over 110,000 BTC were withdrawn in the past month alone, signaling a shift toward self-custody.

### FAQ: Why Do Falling Exchange Balances Matter?
Lower exchange reserves mean fewer coins are available for immediate selling. This scarcity can amplify price gains during buying frenzies, as seen in previous bull markets. Investors moving BTC to cold wallets or personal wallets often signals HODLing behavior.

When coins leave exchanges, theyâ€™re typically stored securely, reducing liquid supply. This dynamic tightens the market, making rallies more sustainable if demand persists.

## Bitcoinâ€™s Network Activity: A Bullish Signal

Bitcoinâ€™s transaction volume Z-scoreâ€”a metric comparing current activity to historical averagesâ€”has surged toward 1. Ted Boydston, a crypto investor, highlights that breaching this threshold has historically preceded major rallies. A Z-score above 1 indicates network usage exceeding its mean by more than one standard deviation, reflecting heightened economic activity and speculative interest.

### FAQ: How Does the Z-Score Predict Price Movements?
The Z-score normalizes transaction volume, filtering out noise to reveal meaningful trends. When it crosses above 1, it often marks a tipping point where institutional inflows and retail FOMO converge, propelling Bitcoin into a full-blown bull phase.

## Technical Outlook: Breaking Resistance

Bitcoin remains stuck in a sideways channel between $101,000 and $104,900. Bulls have made repeated attempts to break above this range but face persistent selling pressure. A daily close above $104,900 with strong momentum would likely confirm a resumption of the uptrend, potentially pushing BTC to $120,000 or higher.

## Conclusion: Accumulation Over Speculation

The current phase reflects a market maturing beyond short-term speculation. Long-term holders are treating pullbacks as buying opportunities, while network fundamentals strengthen. With exchange reserves dwindling and on-chain metrics flashing bullish signals, Bitcoin appears poised for its next parabolic moveâ€”assuming macroeconomic conditions remain favorable.

### FAQ: What Could Derail the Bullish Thesis?
A prolonged drop in network activity, regulatory crackdowns, or a broader market crash could stall Bitcoinâ€™s rally. However, the current on-chain resilience suggests such risks remain low in the near term.

As the Z-score nears critical levels and accumulation continues, the path of least resistance seems upward. Investors would do well to monitor exchange flows and SOPR trends for early warnings of a potential blow-off top or a sustained bull run.
