## Understanding P2P Trading Basics  

Before diving into the steps, it‚Äôs essential to grasp what P2P trading entails. Unlike traditional exchanges, P2P platforms connect buyers directly with sellers, allowing negotiations on price, payment methods, and terms. This decentralized approach offers:  
- **Flexibility**: Choose from multiple payment options (bank transfers, e-wallets, etc.).  
- **Security**: Escrow systems protect both parties during transactions.  
- **Accessibility**: Ideal for regions with limited banking infrastructure.

## Step 1: Logging Into Your KuCoin App

## Step 2: Initiating a Purchase  

### 2.1 Selecting Currency and Cryptocurrency  

1. Choose your preferred **fiat currency** (e.g., USD, EUR) and the **crypto asset** you want to buy (e.g., USDT, BTC).  
2. Enter the fiat amount you wish to spend. The app will automatically calculate the crypto equivalent based on the current exchange rate.  
3. Click **[Buy USDT]** (or your chosen asset) to proceed.  

**Tip**: Compare offers to find the best rates and lowest fees.

### 2.2 Choosing a Payment Method  

Sellers specify their preferred payment methods (e.g., bank transfer, PayPal, Alipay). Select one that suits you:  
- **Bank Transfers**: Reliable but may take 1‚Äì3 business days.  
- **Instant E-Wallets**: Faster but sometimes incur higher fees.  

Ensure your selected method aligns with the seller‚Äôs requirements to avoid delays.  

---

### 2.3 Reviewing Order Details  

Double-check the following before proceeding:  
- **Amount to Pay**: Matches your entered fiat value.  
- **Crypto to Receive**: Confirms the calculated amount.  
- **Seller‚Äôs Terms**: Review any specific instructions (e.g., time limits, documentation).  

---

### 2.4 Transferring Funds to the Seller  

1. The app displays the seller‚Äôs payment details (e.g., bank account number, QR code).  
2. Complete the transfer within the allotted time (usually 15‚Äì30 minutes).  
3. Use the **[Chat]** function to notify the seller and share proof of payment (e.g., a screenshot).  
4. Click **[Pay]** ‚Üí **[Confirm Payment]** once the transaction is done.  

**Critical**: Never mark the payment as complete until you‚Äôve sent funds.  

---

## Step 3: Finalizing the Transaction  

### Seller Confirmation  

After verifying your payment, the seller releases the crypto from escrow to your wallet. This typically takes:  
- **Instantly** for e-wallet transfers.  
- **1‚Äì24 hours** for bank transfers, depending on the region.  

### Viewing Your Assets  

Click **[Transfer Assets]** to check your updated crypto balance.

## Common Issues and Solutions  

### ‚ùì Why Is Proof of Payment Required?  

To prevent fraud, platforms like KuCoin mandate proof of payment (e.g., transaction receipts). This ensures sellers can verify transfers before releasing funds.  

### ‚ùì What If the Seller Doesn‚Äôt Respond?  

Use the **[Need Help?]** button to contact customer support or **[Remind Seller]** to send automated prompts.  

### ‚ùì Can I Cancel an Order?  

Orders can only be canceled if the seller issues a refund. Avoid canceling prematurely to prevent account penalties.
