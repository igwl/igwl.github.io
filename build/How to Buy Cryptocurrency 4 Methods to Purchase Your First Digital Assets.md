## 1. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Transactions

Buying cryptocurrency directly from individuals remains one of the simplest entry points into the market. This method involves connecting with sellers through platforms like social media groups, cryptocurrency forums, or dedicated marketplaces. Here's what you need to know:

- **Process**: Research current market rates using price comparison tools, negotiate terms with sellers, and arrange payment through bank transfers, cash meetups, or digital payment platforms.
- **Blockchain Wallet Requirement**: Before initiating transactions, set up a secure blockchain wallet compatible with your target cryptocurrency. For example, Ethereum (ETH) requires wallets supporting the Ethereum blockchain like MetaMask or Trust Wallet.
- **Security Considerations**: While P2P transactions offer privacy and flexibility, they carry higher fraud risks. Always verify seller credentials, use escrow services when available, and prioritize face-to-face meetings with trusted community members.

|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Price Discovery   | Negotiated       | Market-driven    |
| Liquidity         | Variable         | Consistent       |
| Privacy           | High             | Moderate         |
