This comprehensive guide explores the features, verification process, and user-friendly interface of one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges.  

## What Makes OKX Exchange Stand Out?  

OKX Exchange is a global leader in crypto trading volume for both spot and futures markets.

2. Select "Identity Verification" from the menu  
3. Start with Level 1 verification by uploading a clear photo of your government-issued ID

KYC helps prevent fraud and ensures compliance with global financial regulations. Verified accounts also gain access to higher trading limits and exclusive features.
