## Key Considerations for USDT Transfers  

### **Network Compatibility: TRC20 vs. ERC20**  
- **TRC20** (Tron Network) offers faster and cheaper transactions, while **ERC20** (Ethereum Network) is more widely supported but slower. Always ensure both exchanges support the same network.  

### **Transaction Fees**  
- **OKX** typically charges **$0.0001‚Äì$0.001** for TRC20 transfers, while **ERC20** fees vary with Ethereum gas prices.  
- Binance does **not charge deposit fees** for USDT, but withdrawal fees apply if you transfer elsewhere later.  

### **Minimum Transfer Amounts**  
- OKX and Binance enforce minimum transfer thresholds (e.g., **$10 USDT**). Transferring smaller amounts may result in losses due to fees.  

### **Security Tips**  
- Never share your wallet address or private keys.  
- Use **address whitelists** on Binance to restrict withdrawals to trusted addresses.
