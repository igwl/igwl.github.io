# OKX Node Program Rules and Rebate Guide

## How to Become an OKX Node  

To qualify as an OKX Node, you must successfully invite **10 valid new users** to the platform. Once this threshold is met, you can activate your Node status and start earning rebates.  

### What Defines a Valid New User?  
A valid user must complete a transaction of **50 USDT or more** in any of the following trading categories:  
- Spot trading  
- Flash exchange  
- Futures contracts  
- Margin trading  
- Options trading  

**Note**: Peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions are **not eligible** for validation.  

## How to Earn Rebates  

### Step-by-Step Process  
1. **Create a Custom Invitation Link**  
   Your existing referral link automatically becomes a Node link. You can:  
   - Customize invitation codes  
   - Set rebate percentages for both yourself and invitees  
   - Generate multiple links for different campaigns  

2. **Share Strategically**  
   Distribute your link via social media, forums, or direct outreach. **Pro tip**: Target communities interested in crypto trading or blockchain technology.  

3. **User Activation**  
   New users register via your link and complete qualifying trades. **Important**: Dormant users (inactive for 180+ days) can be reactivated through your Node link, replacing their previous referral relationship.  

4. **Rebate Payouts**  
   Earn rebates from your invitees' trading fees, paid **hourly in USDT**.

### When Are Rebates Not Paid?  
Rebates are suspended in these scenarios:  
| Scenario | Explanation |  
|---------|-------------|  
| **Zero-fee trades** | Certain assets or promotions eliminate fees entirely |  
| **Fee deductions** | Use of rebate cards, experience vouchers, or VIP discounts |  
| **Special rates** | Users with custom fee structures |  
| **Restricted regions** | Users from non-eligible countries |  
| **Professional traders** | Market makers, brokers, or VIP4+ members at rebate caps |  

## Tracking Your Performance  

### Key Metrics Dashboard  
Nodes can monitor:  
- Total invited users' trading volume  
- Cumulative fee generation  
- Hourly rebate earnings  

Navigate to the **"Friends" tab** in your OKX account for real-time analytics.  

### Data Export Options  
Generate detailed reports covering up to **12 months** of activity. Limits:  
- Maximum 30 reports per month  
- Reports remain downloadable for 15 days  

## Node Tier Assessment System  

### Monthly Performance Evaluation  
Your Node level depends on two metrics:  
1. **Monthly trading volume from invitees**  
2. **Number of new/active traders**  

### Default vs. Upgraded Rates  
- Base rebate: **30% of invitee fees**  
- Higher tiers: Unlock increased percentages by exceeding volume/user targets  
- Downgrade: Three consecutive months below targets result in demotion  

### Protection Periods  
New Nodes enjoy tier protection:  
- Join before the 15th of the month: 5-month protection  
- Join after the 15th: 6-month protection  

**Example**: Starting July 1 grants protection until November; starting July 20 extends to December.  

## Expanding Your Network with Helper Links  

### How Helper Links Work  
1. Invite verified OKX users to become helpers  
2. Set helper rebate rates (0â€“40%) and invitee rates (0â€“20%)  
3. Both parties earn rebates from invitee fees

### Key Restrictions  
- Helpers can't modify invitee rebate percentages  
- Fee deductions (e.g., rebate cards) reduce payouts proportionally  
- Both parties access analytics through the Node Program dashboard  

## Prohibited Activities  

OKX reserves the right to revoke Node privileges for:  
1. **Brand impersonation**: Creating lookalike websites (e.g., "okx.xxx.com")  
2. **Social media mimicry**: Operating accounts resembling official handles  
3. **False representation**: Sending emails/SMS as OKX staff  
4. **Trademark bidding**: Advertising with OKX brand terms on Google/Bing  
5. **Self-referral fraud**: Using multiple accounts to inflate metrics  

## Frequently Asked Questions  

**Q: Can inactive users contribute to my Node metrics?**  
A: Yes! Users dormant for 180+ days can be reactivated through your link, earning you rebates.  

**Q: What happens during my protection period?**  
A: Your rebate rate remains at least as high as your initial month's level, even with temporary underperformance.  

**Q: Are there limits on helper link creation?**  
A: Nodes can create unlimited links but must manually set rebate splits for each.  

**Q: How are rebates calculated during fee discounts?**  
A: Rebates reflect the **net fee after discounts** (e.g., using experience vouchers reduces payouts).  

**Q: Can helpers view their performance data?**  
A: Yes, helpers access their rebate analytics directly in the Node Program interface.  

## Maximizing Your Earnings  

### Strategic Tips  
1. **Target high-volume traders**: Focus on communities with strong trading activity  
2. **Use multiple links**: Track performance across different marketing channels  
3. **Leverage helper networks**: Expand reach without sacrificing management control  
4. **Monitor reports**: Identify underperforming links for optimization  

### Long-Term Success  
Maintain consistent performance to avoid demotion. Consider:  
- Hosting trading webinars or tutorials
