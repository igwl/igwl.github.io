## How OKX Pay Enhances Security  

While maintaining the convenience of centralized platforms, OKX Pay employs **private key sharding technology** to safeguard user funds. Here's how it works:  

- **Dual Storage**: Your private keys are split between your device (via a passkey linked to your email) and OKX's servers.  
- **Biometric Authentication**: Access your wallet with fingerprint or facial recognition.  
- **Recovery Options**: Lost your device? Restore access instantly via email verification.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Consideration**: Since funds are managed through the X Layer, users must trust OKX's infrastructure security. Always enable two-factor authentication (2FA) and avoid sharing recovery phrases.
