# ZB.com Announces BCHABC and BCHSV Distribution and Trading Launch

## Introduction to the Bitcoin Cash Fork

The cryptocurrency landscape witnessed a significant event as Bitcoin Cash (BCH) underwent a blockchain split, resulting in two distinct digital assets: Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHABC) and Bitcoin Cash SV (BCHSV). This technical development has prompted exchanges worldwide to implement specific protocols for asset distribution and trading pair activation. ZB.com, a prominent cryptocurrency trading platform, has announced a structured approach to handle this fork, ensuring users receive their entitled assets while maintaining operational transparency.

## Key Dates and Distribution Details

### Snapshot and Distribution Timeline

ZB.com executed a BCH snapshot at 04:40 UTC+8 on November 16, 2018. The exchange guarantees a **1:1 distribution** of both BCHABC and BCHSV tokens to eligible users holding BCH in their accounts during the snapshot period. Key milestones include:

- **November 19, 2018 (19:00 UTC+8)**: Deadline for distributing BCHABC and BCHSV tokens
- **November 19, 2018 (20:00 UTC+8)**: Activation of BCHABC/QC, BCHABC/USDT, BCHSV/QC, and BCHSV/USDT trading pairs
- **November 20, 2018 (UTC+8)**: Commencement of BCH leveraged and collateralized loan liquidation processes

### Distribution Mechanics

Users will automatically receive their forked tokens provided their BCH holdings remained in ZB.com wallets during the snapshot window. Notably, the original BCH trading pairs will remain inactive post-fork, emphasizing the platform's transition to the new assets.

## Trading Pair Activation Strategy

The introduction of four new trading pairs marks ZB.com's commitment to maintaining market liquidity for both forked assets. Traders can engage in BCHABC/QC, BCHABC/USDT, BCHSV/QC, and BCHSV/USDT pairs starting November 19, 2018, at 20:00 UTC+8. This strategic rollout allows market participants to establish positions in both BCH derivatives while maintaining pricing stability.

## Leveraged and Collateralized Loan Protocol

ZB.com has implemented a comprehensive framework to address outstanding BCH loans during the fork period:

### Loan Repayment Requirements

| Loan Type | Repayment Mechanism | Asset Conversion Priority |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Leveraged Loans | 1:1 BCHABC + BCHSV repayment ratio | 1. Account assets<br>2. Future token distribution |
| Collateralized Loans | 1:1 BCHABC + BCHSV repayment ratio | 1. Distribution allocation<br>2. Market purchases<br>3. Collateral liquidation |

### Special Considerations

- **Pre-distribution repayments**: Users repaying loans between the snapshot date and token distribution cutoff will forfeit BCHABC/BCHSV entitlements for repaid BCH amounts
- **Repayment suspension**: Loan repayment functionality will temporarily close during the distribution period
- **Loss mitigation**: ZB.com assumes responsibility for shortfall coverage when user assets prove insufficient post-liquidation

## Network Stability and Fund Operations

While immediate trading access launches on November 19, ZB.com emphasizes that **deposit and withdrawal functionalities** for BCHABC and BCHSV will activate only after confirming blockchain network stability. This precautionary measure safeguards against potential network congestion or technical vulnerabilities during the early stages of the forked chains.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will I receive my BCHABC and BCHSV tokens?
Eligible users will receive their forked tokens by **19:00 UTC+8 on November 19, 2018**, provided BCH holdings remained in ZB.com wallets during the November 16 snapshot window.

### How do I repay BCH loans after the fork?
Repayment requires equal portions of BCHABC and BCHSV. The platform prioritizes using account assets or distribution entitlements before initiating collateral liquidation processes.

## Strategic Considerations for BCH Holders

This blockchain split presents both opportunities and challenges for cryptocurrency investors. Key factors to consider:

1. **Market Volatility**: Forked assets often experience price fluctuations during initial trading periods
2. **Technical Differences**: BCHABC and BCHSV implement distinct blockchain parameters affecting transaction speeds and scalability
3. **Community Support**: Each chain's developer ecosystem and miner adoption rates influence long-term viability
4. **Security Protocols**: Ensure wallet protections remain updated when handling forked tokens
